# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning pipeline to predict house prices using various features such as area, number of bedrooms, and other attributes. It uses a Linear Regression model built with Python and the Scikit-learn library.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for estimating housing prices. It covers the following steps:

- Data collection and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training (Linear Regression)
- Model evaluation
- Predicting prices for new data

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a sample housing dataset, either created or collected manually, typically with the following columns:
- `area` – size of the house (in square feet)
- `bedrooms` – number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms` – number of bathrooms
- `price` – price of the house (target variable)

You can use or create your own CSV file named `data.csv`.

## 🚀 Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the script**
   ```bash
   python house_price_prediction.py
   ```

## 📊 Example Output

Sample prediction output:
```
Predicted price for house with area 3000 sq.ft, 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms: 530000.0
```

## 📎 Files

- `house_price_prediction.py` – main script to run the model
- `data.csv` – sample dataset (not included, create based on the article)
- `requirements.txt` – list of Python dependencies
- `README.md` – project documentation

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Model used**: Linear Regression
- **Library**: `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`
- The model is trained on the cleaned and processed dataset and then used to predict house prices for custom input.

## 📈 Performance

Since it's a basic model, performance may be improved by:
- Using more features (like location, age of house, amenities)
- Applying feature scaling
- Trying more complex models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests)
